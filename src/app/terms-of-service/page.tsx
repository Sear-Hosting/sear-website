      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Fair Usage Policy for Synthetix Minecraft and Game Hosting Plans</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">By default, the Company does not count MySQL database usage towards Your storage allocation. However, certain Minecraft plugins such as Dynmap result in excessively large database files. If the combined storage of your databases exceed 10GB, the Company reserves the right to take one or more of the following actions:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>The Company may reduce your storage allocation by the amount of space your MySQL databases are using.</li>
        <li>The Company may move your database and/or Minecraft server to another node in the same region.</li>

        <li>The Company may ask that you discontinue using the plugin(s) that result in the increased storage.</li>
        <li>The Company may cancel or suspend your service if the excess storage usage is not rectified through any of the above methods.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Bandwidth</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">By default, the Company does not impose limitations on bandwidth for our Minecraft and Game Hosting plans. However, due to the high cost of bandwidth, the Company reserves the right to restrict, suspend, or remove non-Minecraft servers that use greater than 1TB of inbound bandwidth per month OR non-Minecraft servers that are in the top 5% of bandwidth usage during a given period. Common services that may result in action taken due to high bandwidth usage include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Discord Music Streaming Bots</li>
        <li>VPN servers</li>

      <p className="mb-4">If your Service is found to be in violation of Mojang&apos;s EULA, the Service may be suspended until the violating content is removed from the Service.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Terms Specific to Bare Metal Dedicated Servers</h2>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Bare Metal Dedicated Servers</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">The Company offers a 99% monthly Uptime guarantee for all Bare Metal Dedicated Servers. This uptime guarantee is for power and networking services only, and does not include scheduled and communicated maintenance periods. It also does not include network disruption due to Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Downtime is calculated beginning with notification of service impairment and ending when resolved by the Company. Any downtime exceeding 0.01% in a given billing cycle will be compensated as follows:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-2 space-y-1">
        <li>Downtime exceeding 5 minutes but less than or equal to 1 hour will be eligible for a 5% credit.</li>
        <li>Downtime exceeding 1 hour but less than or equal to 2 hours will be eligible for a 10% credit.</li>
        <li>Downtime exceeding 2 hours but less than or equal to 4 hours will be eligible for a 15% credit.</li>
        <li>Downtime exceeding 4 hours but less than or equal to 6 hours will be eligible for a 20% credit.</li>
        <li>Downtime exceeding 6 hours will be eligible for a credit equal to twenty times the percentage of monthly service lost due to downtime up to a maximum of 100%.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">SLA credits must be requested by You within 72 hours following the end of the downtime incident. Credits are provided towards future Company invoices or payments and are not redeemable or refundable for any currency.</p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Bandwidth Limits and Speeds</h3>
      <p className="mb-2">Each product has a specified bandwidth limit that is explicitly stated in the product description and during checkout. Bandwidth calculations include both inbound and outbound traffic as calculated by the raw data provided by the switch that each server is physically connected to. If bandwidth limits are reached during the month, the service will be subject to suspension until a bandwidth add-on is purchased. Bandwidth limits including add-ons only apply to a single month of service and unused bandwidth does not roll over to future months.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Each product also has a specified port speed (such as &quot;1G&quot; indicating a 1Gbps physical connection.) This specified port speed relates to the physical port and accordingly the Company makes no guarantee of throughput speeds.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
